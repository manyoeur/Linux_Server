To grant sudo access to a user in CentOS, the recommended method is to add the user to the wheel group using the usermod command. 
## 1. Log in as the root user

## 2. Add the user to the wheel group:

Use the usermod command with the -aG options to append the user to the supplementary wheel group. Replace <username> with the actual username:
```
usermod -aG wheel <username>
```
logout from user root then login with your own user.

then, you should be able to use sudo command.

# ✅ Done!
